"Ohm's Law is an essential calculation used to figure out the needed resistance, current, or voltage in a circuit." = "Ohm's Law is an essential calculation used to figure out the needed resistance, current, or voltage in a circuit."
"Voltage" = "Voltage"
"Volt(s)" = "Volt(s)"
"Current" = "Current"
"Amp(s)" = "Amp(s)"
"Resistance" = "Resistance"
"Ohm(s)" = "Ohm(s)"
